#What it contains
Codes for 6 animations with a GUI for user to pick (bonus of a mini game as a part of a animation)

#Description 
This project contains the code to run 6 different animation on the readopcForStrands.exe simulator
There is a GUI which is constructed using Tkinter and there are 6 buttons for 6 different animation with a addition exit button to exit the program.
The Tkinter GUI contains error handling and will make sure that the user inputs appropriate inputs to prevent crashing of codes.
The console also have an interaction with the user with error handling.

#Bugs and future improvements
The Tkinter GUI can sometimes go unresponsive due python being slow and the nature of the tkinter. I can improve this in the future with
threading and lambda functions. This will ensure that the GUI stays responsive while the code is running.
I found out that there is a bug for the last animation(PokeQuiz), whenever you type in either the correct/incorrect answer
the led doesnt blink(green/red). This may due to python being slow and i hope to optimise the code in the future so that this does
not happen. Other than this the code runs smoothly without any errors.

#How to run the animations
1.Open the Assessment 3-PDE2400 folder,click on Fadecandy_2400-main.
2.Click on simulator->bin-> depending on ur operating system and the bit of ur pc, choose the appropriate folder.
3.Double click on readopcForStrands.exe
4.Go back to Fadecandy_2400-main folder, click on examples folder
5.Double click on Python Assignment.py 
6. Enjoy the animations
